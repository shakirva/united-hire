        <h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Dear visitors to our website, we are delighted that you are interested in us and the services we offer. It is important to us that you feel safe when visiting our website, including with regard to the protection of your personal data.</p>

        <p>The protection of your personal data is therefore very important to us. Compliance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Telecommunications Act (TKG), and the Telemedia Act (TMG) is our top priority. We therefore want to provide you with comprehensive information on how we collect and process data via our website. In our company, we have taken technical and organizational measures to protect data protection.</p>

        <h2>Responsibility</h2>
        <p>The body named in the imprint is responsible for the data collection and processing described below.</p>

        <h2>Usage Data</h2>
        <p>In order to improve the quality of our websites, we store data about individual access to our pages for statistical purposes. This data set consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The page from which the file was requested</li>
            <li>The name of the file</li>
            <li>The date and time of the request</li>
            <li>The amount of data transferred</li>
            <li>The access status (file transferred, file not found)</li>
            <li>The web browser used</li>
            <li>The IP address of the requesting computer, shortened by the last three digits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored anonymously in accordance with the Telemedia Act (TMG). The creation of personal user profiles is therefore excluded.</p>

        <h2>No Data Transfer to Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We use information that you provide to us when contacting us solely to process your request or to provide online services such as "Request material", "Current offers", "Call service", or "Your opinion". We do not transfer your personal data to third parties.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small files that are stored on a visitor's hard drive. They allow information to be retained over a certain period of time and the visitor's computer to be identified. We use permanent cookies to improve user navigation and to display individual services. We also use so-called session cookies, which are automatically deleted when you close your browser. You can set your browser to inform you about the placement of cookies. This makes the use of cookies transparent for you.</p>

        <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>In order to design our website to meet your needs, we create pseudonymous user profiles with the help of Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and can be read by us. This enables us to recognize returning visitors and count them as such. The data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR and Section 15 Para. 3 TMG and in the interest of finding out how often our websites have been accessed by different users.</p>

        <p>The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, since we have activated IP anonymization on this website, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and only shortened there. We have also concluded a contract for order processing with Google Inc. (USA) in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR. Google will therefore only use all information strictly for the purpose of evaluating the use of our website for us and compiling reports on website activities.</p>

        <p>You can object to the processing at any time. Please use one of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent.</li>
            <li>You can prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.</li>
            <li>You can also prevent Google Analytics from collecting data by clicking on this link. An opt-out cookie will be set which permanently prevents your data from being collected when you visit this website in the future.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Contact Forms</h2>
        <p>To use our contact forms for services such as "Request material", "Current offers", "Call service", "Your opinion" we require (some of) the following data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First and last name</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Telephone number or address if applicable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can optionally provide us with further information. We use your data exclusively to contact you or to send you the requested information on the basis of Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 Letter f of GDPR and in the interest of answering your request as best as possible.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights as a User</h2>
        <p>When processing your personal data, the GDPR grants you as a website user certain rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right to information (Art. 15 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to rectification and erasure (Articles 16 and 17 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR)</li>
